The BikeStationCode python file contains the code about utilizing object oriented programming concepts to create a bikestation object that has a constructor and
multiple methods.

Some of the steps involved:
1. Create a basic class that can hold all relevant Bike data for an individual bike station 
2. Appropriately creating a constructor to set all data values.
3. Use the @property decorator to make the Status in BikeStation class private.
4. Use the @???.setter method to validate the private property in some way before setting its value.
5. Creating one or more regular class methods to CALCULATE other relevant bike station values (percentage full, docks in service, etc) from the data attributes 
   you are storing as a part of the class.
6. Override the __str__ method to print a string representation of a BikeStation that looks like the String below
